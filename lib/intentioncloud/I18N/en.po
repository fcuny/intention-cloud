msgstr "The aggregate results of every search ever entered, every result list ever tendered, and every path taken as a result. <br/>It lives in many places, but three or four places in particular hold a massive amount of this data (i.e. MSN, Google, and Yahoo). This information represents, in aggregate form, a place holder for the intentions of humankind - a massive database of desires, needs, wants, and likes that can be discovered, supoenaed, archived, tracked, and exploited to all sorts of ends. Such a beast has never before existed in the history of culture, but is almost guaranteed to grow exponentially from this day forward. This artifact can tell us extraordinary things about who <a href="http://www.intention-cloud.net/?intention=we+are">we are</a> and what <a href="http://www.intention-cloud.net/?intention=we+want">we want</a> as a culture. And it has the potential to be abused in <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=patriot+act">equally extraordinary fashion</a>."

msgid "whatpar5"
msgstr "The most known way for the public to have a look into searcher's intents is to browse the very limited <a href="http://www.google.com/press/zeitgeist.html">Zeitgeist</a> pages, or watch the (crappy) <a href="http://current.tv/google">Google Current</a> shows. As a big part of Google's incomes are made through AdWords advertising program - the main way for them to monetize their database of intention - advertisers can also use suggestion tools (the <a href="https://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordSandbox">keyword sandbox</a> for example) to select carefully on which terms they want their ads to appear, depending on the past and predicted traffic generated by these searches. <br/><br/>The first module used by the Intention Cloud to collect intentions grabs the results from Google's database of intention through a lesser known service called <a href="http://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1&hl=en">Google Suggest</a>, still in early beta (for quite a long time now..). This service is supposed to 'guess' what you're typing and offers suggestions in real time, in groups of 10 queries maximum. The metrics displayed and the algorithm used to power this tool are quite obscure, and their FAQ doesn't bring much more clarity on it : "Our algorithms use a wide range of information to predict the queries users are most likely to want to see. For example, Google Suggest uses data about the overall popularity of various searches to help rank the refinements it offers. An example of this type of popularity information can be found in the Google Zeitgeist".<br/><br/>This first version of the Intention Cloud based on Google is merely a proof of concept, in the near future we will integrate other services that give similar but more accurate results on multiple databases of intentions. For the moment, this hack of Google Suggest is enough to probe the various possibilities of such a tool."

msgid "whatpar6"
msgstr "(more traditionally known as a weighted list in the field of visual design) is a visual depiction of content  tags used on a website. Often, more frequently used tags are depicted in a larger font or otherwise emphasized, while the displayed order is generally alphabetical. (...) The first tag cloud appeared on Flickr, the photo sharing site. That implementation was based on Jim Flanagan's Search Referral Zeitgeist, a visualization of web site referrers. Tag clouds have also been popularised by Technorati, among others. (excerpts from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_cloud">Wikipedia's article</a>)<br/><br/>The Intention Cloud uses weighted lists to display the intents collected from databases of intention. The metric associated with each returned query, generally reflecting its popularity or traffic over a period of time, is used to calculate its printed size. Therefore, the more popular an intent the bigger it will be displayed inside the cloud. Colors are helping to intuitively separate the weights of the results."

msgstr "Usage is quite straightforward: Enter your intention seed in the text field, press "See" button, wait, observe the resulting cloud.<br/><br/>In its standard usage, the Cloud engine will 'bruteforce' Google Suggest using the provided seed to gather each time up to 10 results. For example, if you enter the intention seed [i want], the engine will collect results with [i want a] then [i want b] etc.. <br/>These results are then displayed using in a tag cloud format with the (fuzzy) 'results' metric, and archived to enable permalinks and to datamine these later.<br/><br/>Depending on the engine selected for the Intention Cloud, you may have one or multiple options to choose from. Currently, the Google Suggest engine supports truncation. When this checkbox is selected, the Cloud generator will include results gathered with a truncated query. This means that the intention seed [ meta ] combined with the 'trunctation' option will render results such as "metallica" or "metaphores"<br/><br/>Intention seeds are also archived in a local database, in order to show our own cloud of requests (meta-cloud)"

Mashups of services and concepts are very trendy these days, and are a one of the pillars of the so-called Web2.0 new era. We wanted to add a brick to the building. But with style.<br/><br/>The core of the concept came from our IRC channel, were we run some bots to answer some on-the-fly commands, like catching and submitting our URLs to del.icio.us automatically, checking the rankings of our MMORPG characters, performing queries on search engines etc. One of the modules we created grabs results from Google Suggest, and is called using the command "!suggest keyword". The fact that we had a weighted list as an output for that tool lead to the idea of formatting the results using a 'tag cloud' like design pattern.<br/>Franck created a prototype, and we had a lot of lulz playing with it. And we knew it was right. Our designer then got a grasp of the tag cloud concept, and interpreted it literally. He imagined a really nice layout for the tool, putting a lot of effort into bringing a sense of beauty and design in this so 2.0 project.<br/><br/>Note also that we are conviced that such tools should be used by everybody, to understand what Intentions are, what they represent, and what companies possessing the huge Databases of Intention can do with those.<br/>John Battelle wrote in his chapter introducing this concept something that everybody should read and understand, and then look again at the current big players of the web industry : "What does the world want? Build a company that answers this question in all its shades of meaning, and you've unlocked the most intractable riddle of marketing, of business, and arguably of human culture itself."<br/>You can watch Google Current, and get brainwashed, or watch the Clouds, and relax.<br/><br/>And here we are, releasing our Intention Cloud for the public to experiment with, and observing what will happen. We expect a lot of constructive criticism and nice ideas to come from this prototype, and are looking forward to reading your comments (by mail or on the Intention Cloud blog)."
